/*
Write a program Euclidean distance between two points as well as the equation of the line using those two points. Use Math functions Math.pow() and Math.sqrt()
Hint =>
Take inputs for 2 points x1, y1, and x2, y2
Method to find the Euclidean distance between two points and return the distance
distance = (x2-x1)2 +(y2-y1)2
Write a Method to find the equation of a line given two points and return the equation which includes the slope and the y-intercept
The equation of a line is given by the equation y = m*x + b Where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. So firstly compute the slope using the formulae
m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
Post that compute the y-intercept b using the formulae
b = y1 - m*x1
Finally, return an array having slope m and y-intercept b
